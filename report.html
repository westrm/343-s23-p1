  <p>I have created this site using the design portion as my end goal, not only did it give me a rough idea of how I wanted things placed, but after adding the content and adjusting the color palette, I felt comfortable with the end result. That being said, I changed some of the website's final product away from the design phase, such as hovering over images to display information. I felt as if this change was more interactive for the end user. 
  
  Currently the form displays an email entry and message box, but it will cause the webpage to crash since it is not connected in any way.
